## Lazy writer's notes
If there are two most important things I've got from this book, those will be:
- **Choose to be responsible for things that happened in your life** regardless of whether or not you are the cause of it.
- **Action isn't just the effect of motivation, it's also the cause of it**. So not only motivation -> action but also action -> motivation

From my personal experience, these two key ideas switch your brain from going on defense to offense.  
It stops you from waiting for the **right moment**, **right condition** to act. Rather just act, make mistakes and move on.
And that idea alone is already a very powerful concept.

## Book Summary
### Chapter 1: Don't try
- **The feedback loop from Hell ...**  
Ever screwed up something, and then feel bad about that, and then feel bad about feeling bad about that ?  
**Welcome to the feedback loop from Hell!**  
This part of the book explains why we are the only animals that experience this type of pressure and how to resolve it.

- **The Subtle art of not giving a F\*ck**  
This explains the mission of the book.  
The book is not trying to tell you not to give any f\*ck about anything (like your first impression on the title)  
It wants you, however, to conciously choose the f*cks you wanna give. And why is it important ?
