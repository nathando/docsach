## Lazy writer's notes
If there are two most important things I've got from this book, those will be:
- **Choose to be responsible for things that happened in your life** regardless of whether or not you are the cause of it.
- **Action isn't just the effect of motivation, it's also the cause of it**. So not only motivation -> action but also action -> motivation

From my personal experience, these two key ideas switch your brain from going on defense to offense.  
It stops you from waiting for the **right moment**, **right condition** to act. Rather just act, make mistakes and move on.
And that idea alone is already a very powerful concept.

## Book Summary

### Chapter 1: Don't try
- **The feedback loop from Hell ...**  
![Feedback loop](/images/posts/subtle-art/icon-loop.png)
Ever screwed up something, and then feel bad about that, and then feel bad about feeling bad about that ?  
**Welcome to the feedback loop from Hell!**  
This part of the book explains why we are the only animals that experience this type of pressure and how to resolve it.  

> The desire for more positive experience is itself a negative experience. And, paradoxically, the acceptance of one's 
negative experience is itself a positive experience

Say what ? Read it again...

- **The Subtle art of not giving a Fuck**

This explains the mission of the book.  
The book is not trying to tell you NOT to give ANY fuck about anything (like your first impression on the title)  
It wants you, however, to conciously CHOOSE the fucks you wanna give. And why is it important ?

> Because when you give too many fucks - when you give a fuck about everyone and everything - you will feel that you're perpeptually entitled to be comfortable and 
happy at all times, that everything is supposed to be just exactly the fucking way *you want it to be*. This is a sickness. And it will eat you alive. 
You will see every day adversity as an injustice, every inconvenience as a personal slight, every disagreement as a betrayal

### Chapter 2: Happiness IS a Problem
This chapter is interesting, it uses well-known story to lead you into perspective about happiness.  
Will you actually be happy once you have all the physical things that you've been longing for ?  

A mix of Buddha and Pandas seems to be quite quirky at first. But eventually it does make sense.  

- **Happiness Comes from Solving Problems**
While the majority of us were being taught (or expected) to pursue happiness, not a lot understands where it comes from, espcially for ourselves.  

> Happiness is a constant work-in-progress, because solving problems is a constant work-in-progress -- 
the solution to today's problems will lay the foundation for tomorrow's problems, and so on.
True happiness occurs only when you find the problems you enjoy having and enjoy solving

However, most of people think their life is not that simple. And it is because of 2 main reasons:  
- **Denial**: "My life does not have a(that) problem"
- **Victim Mentality**: "There is nothing I can do about this" even if they actually could.  

With this two excuses, what they do instead is having more fucks to give about everything, trying to forget the real problems that need solving.

- **Choose your struggle**
When we aim for something, we usually only consider the benefits, the good side of achieving that. 
We, rarely, actually consider the bad side, the sufferings. For example, nowadays, **entrepreneur** is such a buzz word that every one is looking up to. 
However, not a lot of people will see the sufferings or sacrifices the successful entrepreneurs has gone through to reach success. 
From super burnt out to taking a risk of having no money for own survival.

**-----Personally, I think this chaper is a very important door that opens to other realizations in following chapter----**

### Chapter 3: You are not special  
This is the chapter that hits home run for me. Because I have seen it way too often where I've lived and worked. **ENTITLEMENT** is the word.
